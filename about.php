     font-display:unset;">Siwaka Bakery was established in the year 2000. It is to celebrate its 24th year<br> this year in july.
    It was initially opened as a small shop that would sell tea and maandazi<br> to the 
students of the nearby university. in 2010, Siwaka Bakery made a brakethrough and we<br> were able to expand. We then 
introduced ne desserts to the area and we soon became popular, not only amongst the students <br>but also amongst
different age groups as people would come different parts of the country to indulge in our delicacies<br>

of the most famous bakeries in Kenya!
